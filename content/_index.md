    Painless Embedded Rust
</h1>

You developing your next firmware application in Rust, but you don't have time to get bogged down in hardware specifics. **I can help you focus on the work that truly matters**, by taking the low-level infrastructure off your hands. Go back to working on your core product, and leave the rest to me.

{% testimonial(author="James Munns", org="Ferrous Systems") %}
<p>
    I would highly recommend Hanno to anyone looking for embedded development support in Rust. He quickly researched the unknowns in the scope of the project, and provided some really valuable insights into what was, and what wasn't, necessary to meet my goals.
</p>
<p>
    This helped to keep costs down, while still getting me the things that were important for my project.

<div>
    <h3>Board bring-up and microcontroller support</h3>
    <p>
        Rust libraries for your target hardware don't exist or don't suit your needs? I got you covered. From basic support to get you started, to a fully type-safe hardware abstraction layer: I can shield you from the low-level difficulties and keep you productive.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Drivers for external sensors and actuators</h3>
    <p>
        Want to talk to that accelerometer on your board? Or having trouble using that radio transceiver? Let's talk. I'll deal with the problems and give you a safe, convenient, and documented Rust API. No need to learn all the intricacies, if you just want to use the features.
    </p>

<div>
    <h3>Custom embedded software</h3>
    <p>
        Do you need custom control software for that device you're working on? Or maybe you need someone to implement a specific library, to aid you with your project? I'm always happy to talk about custom software development projects in the embedded space. {{ email_address(text="Contact me") }}, and we'll figure out the best way forward for you.
