    Painless Embedded Rust
</h1>

You are going to develop your next firmware application in Rust, but you don't have time to get bogged down in hardware specifics. **I can help you focus on the work that truly matters**, by taking the low-level infrastructure off your hands. Go back to working on your core product, and let me do what I do best.

{% testimonial(author="James Munns", org="Ferrous Systems") %}
<p>
    I would highly recommend Hanno to anyone looking for embedded development support in Rust. He quickly researched the unknowns in the scope of the project, and provided some really valuable insights into what was, and what wasn't, necessary to meet my goals.
</p>

<p>
    This helped to keep costs down, while still getting me the things that were important for my project.

## What I can do

<div>
    <h3>Board bring-up and microcontroller support</h3>
    <p>
        Rust libraries for your target hardware don't exist or don't suit your needs? I got you covered. From basic support to get you started, to a fully type-safe hardware abstraction layer: I can shield you from the low-level difficulties and keep you productive.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Drivers for external sensors and actuators</h3>
    <p>
        Want to talk to that accelerometer on your board? Or having trouble using that radio transceiver? Let's talk. I'll deal with the problems and give you a safe, convenient, and documented Rust API. No need to learn all the intricacies, if you just want to use the features.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Custom embedded software</h3>
    <p>
        Do you need custom control software for that device you're working on? Or maybe you need someone to implement a specific library, to aid you with your project? I'm always happy to talk about custom software development projects in the embedded space. {{ email_address(text="Contact me") }}, and we'll figure out the best way forward for you.

## What my clients say

{% testimonial(author="James Munns", org="Ferrous Systems", link="https://ferrous-systems.com/") %}
<p>
    I am absolutely pleased with how this project went. Your professionalism, creativity in scoping and execution of the project, as well as your very clear desire to meet and exceed the scope of the project made this work an absolute joy.
</p>
{% end %}

{% testimonial(author="Louis Thiery", org="Helium Systems", link="https://www.helium.com/") %}
<p>
    I would say this has been the lowest touch contractor relationship I've had (over the last 3 years or so, I've worked with roughly 3 large agencies, and 4~5 independent contractors).
</p>
{% end %}

{% testimonial(author="Philip Markgraf", org="Georg Fischer Signet", link="http://www.gfsignet.com/") %}
<p>
    The biggest surprise is there was no surprise. The project mostly worked as hoped.
</p>
{% end %}

<!--
{% testimonial(author="Louis Thiery", org="Helium Systems", link="https://www.helium.com/") %}
<p>
    This fixed bid format was a first for me and it turned out very positive; I've otherwise tended to hear negative feedback from both contractors and clients on fixed bid engagements, so I'm glad we were able to see it "done right" with you.
</p>
{% end %}

{% testimonial(author="Philippe Delrieu", org="MD69 Solutions") %}
<p>
    It surprised me when you refused to increase the price after spending more time than expected.

This project for Ferrous Systems involved building the software stack required to use the DWM1001 in Rust, including a board support package for the DWM1001 module and development board, a DW1000 driver, and a partial implementation of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
